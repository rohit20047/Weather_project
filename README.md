My First Weather Project
Welcome to my first weather project on GitHub! This project is a simple weather application that allows users to get current weather conditions for any location in the world. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the Rapid API.

Features
Users can enter the name of a city or town to get the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
The application uses the Rapid API to retrieve weather data in real-time from multiple weather sources.
The user interface is built using Bootstrap, making it easy to use and visually appealing on desktop and mobile devices.
The application is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
Getting Started
To get started with this weather application, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. You will need an API key from Rapid API to retrieve weather data. Once you have your API key, you can add it to the JavaScript file and start using the application.
